# rock_paper_scissors_project

As I am a compsci major, I'm not new to coding. I've worked with Python and C before.

That experience helped me breeze through this, I find JS simple and easy to work with. Although I'll admit I'm not yet completely familiar with syntax. That's why some things needed googling. But overall this is some pretty basic logic that's being applied here.

Nothing to note as of yet.
